# Recon Tool

A Python Streamlit web application for reconnaissance and contact information extraction from professional sites, mimicking SignalHire functionality.

## Features

- **Streamlit Web UI**: Interactive web interface for easy reconnaissance
- **Multi-Site Support**: LinkedIn and other professional platforms
- **Contact Extraction**: Emails and phone numbers with validation
- **OSINT Integration**: theHarvester for comprehensive email harvesting
- **Data Export**: JSON and CSV export capabilities
- **Verification**: Email and phone number validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time scraping progress with visual indicators

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install theHarvester (optional, for enhanced OSINT):
```bash
# Install from GitHub or package manager
pip install theHarvester
# or
git clone https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester
cd theHarvester
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Launch the Application

```bash
# Launch via main.py launcher
python main.py

# Or run Streamlit directly
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser to the displayed URL (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter a profile URL or person name in the web interface

4. Click "🔍 Start Reconnaissance"

5. View extracted contacts with validation status

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- This tool is for educational and research purposes only
- Respect website terms of service and robots.txt
- LinkedIn and other sites have strict scraping policies
- Use responsibly and obtain permission when necessary
- Rate limiting and delays are implemented to minimize impact

## Troubleshooting

### LinkedIn Scraping Issues
- LinkedIn requires authentication for full profiles
- Use undetected-chromedriver for better success rates
- Consider manual data entry for critical reconnaissance

### theHarvester Not Found
- Ensure theHarvester is installed and in PATH
- Check Python path if installed via pip
- Some systems may require sudo for installation

### Import Errors
- Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Some packages may require specific Python versions
- Check for conflicting package versions

## Development

### Adding New Scrapers

1. Create a new scraper in `scrapers/` directory
2. Implement a scrape function that returns structured data
3. Update `app.py` to use the new scraper
4. Add any required dependencies to `requirements.txt`

### Extending Contact Extraction

1. Add new regex patterns in `utils/extractors.py`
2. Implement validation functions for new contact types
3. Update the extraction pipeline in `extract_contacts()`
